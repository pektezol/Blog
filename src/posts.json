[{"id":"blog-init","title":"Blog Init","author":"Arda Serdar Pektezol","date":"2023-01-21","content":"\nThis is the start of my new blog.\n\nI do not have any frontend experience, hence the motivation of this project. This website is built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), and posts are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).\n\nIt is weird to say, but I have gotten a lot of good ideas and a guideline on how I would go on about making this blog using ChatGPT. Future potential of language models and GPT-4 is.. interesting.\n\nHopefully there will be more posts and improvements to the blog. It does need a good design. Take care."}]
