[{"id":"blog-init","title":"Blog Init","author":"Arda Serdar Pektezol","date":"2023-01-25","content":"\nThis is the start of my new blog.\n\nI do not have any frontend experience, hence the motivation of this project. This website is built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), and posts are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).\n\nThere were a lot of headaches when deploying this blog via Github pages. I learned that apparently gh-pages does not support (at least, natively) Single Page Applications. So, I had a lot of trouble with the React Router and tried a lot of workarounds. In the end, I said fuck it and deployed it via a proper web server, nginx. It works flawlessly and it does not give me any trouble (so far).\n\nIt is weird to say, but I have gotten a lot of good ideas and a guideline on how I would go on about making this blog using ChatGPT. Future potential of language models and GPT-4 is.. interesting.\n\nHopefully there will be more posts and improvements to the blog. It does need a good design. Take care."}]
